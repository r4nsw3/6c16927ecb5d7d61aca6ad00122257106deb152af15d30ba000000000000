  |   Episode 2 DLC needs to be installed on the main game with Title ID    |
  |   010060F00AA70000. That release did not contain ALL EPISODES!          |
  |   The base game only contains Episode 1. New Episodes come out later!   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The original release failed to include the downloadable content for   |
  |   the additional languages. These languages would not work without an   |
  |   active internet connection and owning the legit game to verify        |
  |   with the servers.                                                     |

  |   As a bonus we have included all the necessary content to enable       |
  |   audio and subtitles of foreign languages for both Episode 1 and 2.    |
  |   No internet connection is required. Enjoy the complete version!       |
